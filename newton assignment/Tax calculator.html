    You need to complete the function findTax() that takes a number type
    variable as an argument which is the salary of a person. You need to
    calculate the tax amount on his salary by using the Js switch control flow.
    The tax rates are given below. if 500000 >= salary > 0 then 0% tax on the
    entire salary. If 1000000 >= salary > 500000 then 10% tax on the entire
    salary. If 1500000 >= salary > 1000000 then 20% tax on the entire salary. If
    the salary > 1500000 then 30% tax on the entire salary. If someone by
    mistake enters a salary that is less than 0 then you need to throw the
    ValidationError() error whose argument will be "Salary not valid". Put this
    code inside a try-and-catch block, so that the error is caught in the catch
    block, and then "Salary not valid" should be returned.

    <script>
      function findTax(salary) {
        let tax = 0;
        try {
          if (salary < 0) {
            throw new ValidationError("Salary not valid");
          } else if (salary <= 500000) {
            tax += 0;
          } else if (salary <= 1000000) {
            tax += salary * 0.1;
          } else if (salary <= 1500000) {
            tax += salary * 0.2;
          } else {
            tax += salary * 0.3;
          }
        } catch (err) {
          return err.message;
        }
        return tax;
      }
    </script>
